Introduction to the Library Management System Project
The Library Management System project is designed to efficiently manage a collection of books using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. This project aims to provide a practical application of BSTs in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), demonstrating their utility in organizing and managing data.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Efficient Book Management: To enable efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of books based on unique identifiers (IDs).
2. Practical Application of BST: To illustrate the use of BSTs in real-world scenarios, enhancing understanding of tree-based data structures.
3. User-Friendly Interface: To provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

Features
The Library Management System includes the following features:

. Add Book: Allows users to add new books to the library by specifying the book ID, title, and author.
. Search Book: Enables users to search for books by their ID, displaying relevant details if the book is found.
. Display Books: Lists all books in the library in an ordered manner, leveraging the in-order traversal of the BST.
. Delete Book: Provides functionality to remove books from the library based on their ID.

Implementation Details
The project is implemented in C++ and utilizes a BST to store and manage book records. Each node in the BST represents a book, containing the bookâ€™s ID, title, and author. The BST ensures that all operations (insertion, deletion, and searching) are performed efficiently, maintaining the properties of the tree.
